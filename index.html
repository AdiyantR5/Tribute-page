         <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align:center;"><big><i>Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. They originally consisted of Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), John Deacon(bass guitar), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music.</i></big></p>

       <h1 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align:center; background-color: white ;">Timeline of Queen</h1>
       <ul style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:Arial; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
         <li>1968–74: <strong><em>Early days</em></strong> - In 1968, guitarist Brian May, a student at London's Imperial College, and bassist Tim Staffell decided to form a band. May placed an advertisement on a college notice board for a "Mitch Mitchell/Ginger
            Baker type" drummer; Roger Taylor, a young dental student, auditioned and got the job. The group called themselves Smile.</li><br>
         <li>1974–76: <strong><em>Sheer Heart Attack to A Night at the Opera</em></strong> - Released in 1974, Sheer Heart Attack reached number two in the United Kingdom, sold well throughout Europe, and went gold in the United States. It gave the band their
            first real experience of international success, and was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. The album experimented with a variety of musical genres, including British music hall, heavy metal, ballads, ragtime, and Caribbean.
         </li><br>
         <li>1976–79: <strong><em>A Day at the Races to Live Killers</em></strong> - By 1976, Queen were back in the studio recording A Day at the Races, which is often regarded as a sequel album to A Night at the Opera. It again borrowed the name of a Marx
            Brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of A Night at the Opera, a variation on the same Queen Crest. The most recognisable of the Marx Brothers, Groucho Marx, invited Queen to visit him in his Los Angeles home in March 1977; there
            the band thanked him in person, and performed "39" a cappella.</li><br>
         <li>1980–84: <strong><em>The Game to The Works</em></strong> - Queen began their 1980s career with The Game. It featured the singles "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" and "Another One Bites the Dust", both of which reached number one in the US.
         </li><br>
         <li>1985–88: <strong><em>Live Aid and later years</em></strong> - In January 1985, the band headlined two nights of the first Rock in Rio festival at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and played in front of over 300,000 people each night.[107] The Boston Globe
            described it as a "mesmerising performance".</li><br>
         <li>1988–92: <strong><em>Mercury: illness, death, and tribute</em></strong> - After fans noticed Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance in 1988, rumours began to spread that Mercury was suffering from AIDS. Mercury flatly denied this, insisting
            he was merely "exhausted" and too busy to provide interviews.</li><br>
         <li>1995–03: <strong><em>Made in Heaven to 46664 Concert</em></strong> - Queen's last album featuring Mercury, titled Made in Heaven, was finally released in 1995, four years after his death.</li><br>
         <li>2004–09: <strong><em>Queen + Paul Rodgers</em></strong> - At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's
            website also stated that Rodgers would be "featured with" Queen as "Queen + Paul Rodgers", not replacing Mercury. </li><br>
         <li>2009–11: <strong><em>Departure from EMI, 40th anniversary</em></strong> - On 20 May 2009, May and Taylor performed "We Are the Champions" live on the season finale of American Idol with winner Kris Allen and runner-up Adam Lambert providing a
            vocal duet.</li><br>
         <li>2011–present: <strong><em>Queen + Adam Lambert, Queen Forever</em></strong> - On 25 and 26 April, May and Taylor appeared on the eleventh series of American Idol at the Nokia Theatre, Los Angeles, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists
            on the first show, and the following day performed "Somebody to Love" with the 'Queen Extravaganza' band.</li>
